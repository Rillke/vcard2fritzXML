# DOWNLOAD

As long as there is no distribution, you must download and build the tool itself.

    git clone https://github.com/berkholz/vcard2fritzXML
    
    
# BUILD

To compile and generate JAR file with and without dependencies call:

	mvn clean package


# COMMANDLINE USAGE

It depends on the JAR file.

## JAR file with no dependencies

Use the shell script:

    ./vcard2fritzXML.sh -h

Convert a vcard directly with Maven:

    mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="-f <PATH/TO/VCARDFILE.vcf>"


## JAR file with dependencies

To call vcard2fritzXML help:
    
    java -jar /PATH/TO/vcard2fritzXML_HOME/target/vcard2fritzXML-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -h


# USAGE
To import a vcard to your Fritz!Box you have to generate a valid vcard. 
On an Mac you can use the Addressbook: 
* Open Addressbook 
* Go to the group or contact 
* Choose option "export vcard..."
* Save the file to a location where you can find it on a commandline, mostly everywhere ;)

Now you can convert the vcard file to the Fritz!Box xml file:

    java -jar /PATH/TO/vcard2fritzXML-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -f "<PATH/TO/VCARDFILE.vcf>" -o "<PATH/TO/FRITZ!BOX_XML_FILE.xml>" -n "Addressbook"

Go to your Fritz!Box and create a new Telphonebook named "Addressbook" and recover your Telephonebook with the XML file.


# DEVELOPMENT

Use the specific Maven goal to generate IDE projects file, e.g. for Eclipse

    mvn eclipse:eclipse

Netbeans should open it nativly as a project.
